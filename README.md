# üí´ About Me:
Hello world! üåè<br><br>My name is Tessa and I'm an alumnus of [Codam Coding College](https://www.codam.nl/en/about-codam) (part of the [42 Network](https://www.42network.org/)) where I studied to become a Software Engineer. Before entering the wonderful world of tech, I went to law school and worked as a legal advisorüë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è. Learning how to code has given me the thrill and challenge of learning and puzzle-solving that I was lacking in my previous occupations. It is the gift that keeps on giving!üéÅ<br><br> üî≠ In addition to the Codam curriculum, I've worked as a full-stack developer, building [a web app](https://app.web3circleoftrust.com/) in React, Node.JS and PostgreSQL and launching it on AWS. I also created conversational AI chatbots in Python by integrating various AI tools in my job as AI developer. Currently, I'm expanding my skillset by learning Java.

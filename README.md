### Hello world! 🌏

My name is Tessa and I'm a Software Engineering student at [Codam](https://www.codam.nl/en/about-codam) (part of the [42 Network](https://www.42network.org/)). Before entering the wonderful world of tech, I went to law school and worked as a legal advisor👩‍⚖️. Learning how to code has given me the thrill and challenge of learning and puzzle-solving that I was lacking in my previous occupations. It is the gift that keeps on giving!🎁

:telescope: Currently I'm working on a progressive web app in React, JS and GraphQL on AWS Amplify with DynamoDB.


Here you'll find the projects I completed at Codam, which are written in:
